        The [tree-year undergraduate programme](https://www.di.unipi.it/en/) in Computer Science aims to integrate 
        the comprehension of information technology and its application in problem solving activities with a solid 
        scientific and methodological preparation. 
        My [thesis work](https://github.com/nomadster/lamg_cpp) consisted in porting an algebraic multigrid algorithm from its Matlab implementation into
        the [Operations Research Group](http://www.di.unipi.it/optimize/) framework, which is written using C++.
        
        I graduated with a score of 101 out of 110.
